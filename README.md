# Stats_Project_4
Contains statistical analysis on a dataset with phosphorylation ratios obtained by mass spectrometry

This repository is split into four different workflows made with R, each taking a different approach at analysing the dataset:
- sigmoidal model fitting
- correlation between number of basic residues and rate of dephosphorylation
- clustering by dephosphorylation kinetics
- limma
